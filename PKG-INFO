Description: Levenshtein Python extension and C library.
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        The Levenshtein Python C extension module contains functions for fast
        computation of
        
        * Levenshtein (edit) distance, and edit operations
        
        * string similarity
        
        * approximate median strings, and generally string averaging
        
        * string sequence and set similarity
        
        It supports both normal and Unicode strings.
        
        Please see PKG-INFO for basic info, NEWS for news and the top of
        Levenshtein.c for TODO.
        
        Python 2.2 or newer is required.
        
        StringMatcher.py is an example SequenceMatcher-like class built on the top of
        Levenshtein.  It misses some SequenceMatcher's functionality, and has some
        extra OTOH.
        
        Levenshtein.c can be used as a pure C library, too.  You only have to define
        NO_PYTHON preprocessor symbol (-DNO_PYTHON) when compiling it.  The
        functionality is similar to that of the Python extension.  No separate docs
        are provided yet, RTFS.  But they are not interchangeable:
        - C functions exported when compiling with -DNO_PYTHON (see Levenshtein.h)
          are not exported when compiling as a Python extension (and vice versa)
        - Unicode character type used with -DNO_PYTHON is wchar_t, Python extension
          uses Py_UNICODE, they may be the same but don't count on it
        
        gendoc.sh generates HTML API documentation (the same as on my www pages),
        you probably want a selfcontained instead of includable version, so run
        in `./gendoc.sh --selfcontained'.  It needs Levenshtein already installed
        and genextdoc.py (http://trific.ath.cx/Ftp/python/genextdoc.py).
